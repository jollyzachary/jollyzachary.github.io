# Zachary Jolly's Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website. This site showcases my projects, skills, and experiences in the field of software development and data science.

## Overview

This portfolio website is built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It's designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience across different devices.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `public`: This directory contains static files such as images.
- `src`: This directory contains the main JavaScript files for the website.
- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the website.
- `app.js`: This is the main JavaScript file that powers the website's interactivity.
- `package.json`: This file contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.

## Running Locally

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you have Node.js installed, you can start a local server using a command like `npx serve` or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` for Python.
